    TODO: there are alleged certificate chain issues that may cause the following error
    when posting to the endpoint (this is related to self-signed certificates):

      {
        "error": {
          "name": "Error",
          "status": 500,
          "message": "unable to verify the first certificate",
          "code": "UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE",
          "stack": "Error: unable to verify the first certificate\n    at Error (native)\n    at TLSSocket.<anonymous> (_tls_wrap.js:1003:38)\n    at emitNone (events.js:67:13)\n    at TLSSocket.emit (events.js:166:7)\n    at TLSSocket._finishInit (_tls_wrap.js:570:8)"
        }
      }

    The short-term work-around is to set an environment variable that influences the TLS library:

      export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED="0"

    an alternative is to set this in `src/server.js` as:

      process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0"

      ...although this feels icky.

   For testing, I've set this in my `lauch.json`'s `env` section.
